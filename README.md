### Project Status <a name="status" />

As of writing this Readme, August 6, 2022, this is an ongoing project.

- Currently, only the Resumé page is fully operational. However, there are still features I would like to add.
- Planned pages include a simple about section, a more general first page, a blog, and an interests page.
- As a result, the only functioning links are those that go to

### Future Plans (as of 08/06/2022) <a name="plans" />

At the moment, the plan is to create pages for the links that have no target, and add in functionality. This means the tasks are:

- Create about, blog, and interests pages.
- Add appropriate functionality for each page if needed. (I.E. simple database and backend server for blog page, potentially comment system, likes/sharing, etc).

### What I Have Learned <a name="learnings" />

This project has so far been interesting. It has helped me get more familiar with front-end work in particular. The most prominent things I became more comfortable with was using flexbox and responsive design principles to make sure the site displays appropriately at any resolution. I also incorporated many little things that I was studying at the time.
For example, lazy loading images likely to be offscreen and using srcset to serve appropriately sized images.

### Thank You <a name="thanks" />

Thank you for your interest! I am just beginning my coding journey and as such there are likely many things I did inefficiently, or perhaps there are anti-patterns I used that I was unaware were not recommended, or my comment style could be better, etc. If so, please let me know a better way. My pride can take it.

Also if you are new to coding as well, I hope that my code can help you in some way. Either through inspiration or serving as some kind of example.
